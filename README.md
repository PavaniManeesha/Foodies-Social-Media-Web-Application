### Description about our project :eyes:
Welcome to our FoodCitric web application for food lovers and reviewers! We've used the latest technologies such as Spring Boot for the backend and React JS for the frontend, to create a seamless and enjoyable user experience. Our app offers a variety of features, including the ability to create user profiles, search and follow other users, and share your love of food by posting reviews and photos of your favorite dishes. But that's not all! We also encourage users to engage with each other by adding comments to posts and reviews, helping to build a strong and supportive community of food enthusiasts. So come and join us on our journey to explore the wonderful world of food, share your experiences, and connect with other like-minded individuals!
